# macOS Technical Support Practice

This repository documents my daily hands-on practice and notes as I prepare for having a better understanding of the **macOS**. Each day focuses on a key area of the system, blending real-world tasks with terminal-level operations.

## Goals

- Build confidence navigating and configuring macOS systems.
- Practice using GUI and CLI tools for user support.
- Understand core macOS subsystems (network, security, logs, MDM, etc).
- Develop a reproducible workflow for onboarding and troubleshooting.
